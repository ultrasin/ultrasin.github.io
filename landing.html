          <p>
            Memories consume <br/>
            Like opening the wound<br/>
            I'm picking me apart again<br/>
            You all assume<br/>
            I'm safe here in my room<br/>
            Unless I try to start again<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't want to be the one<br/>
            The battles always choose<br/>
            'Cause inside I realize<br/>
            That I'm the one confused<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know what's worth fighting for<br/>
            Or why I have to scream<br/>
            I don't know why I instigate<br/>
            And say what I don't mean<br/>
            I don't know how I got this way<br/>
            I know it's not alright<br/>
            So, I'm breaking the habit<br/>
            I'm breaking the habit tonight<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Clutching my cure<br/>
            I tightly lock the door<br/>
            I try to catch my breath again<br/>
            I hurt much more<br/>
            Than anytime before<br/>
            I had no options left again<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't want to be the one<br/>
            The battles always choose<br/>
            'Cause inside, I realize<br/>
            That I'm the one confused<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know what's worth fighting for<br/>
            Or why I have to scream<br/>
            I don't know why I instigate<br/>
            And say what I don't mean<br/>
            I don't know how I got this way<br/>
            I'll never be alright<br/>
            So, I'm breaking the habit<br/>
            I'm breaking the habit tonight<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I'll paint it on the walls<br/>
            'Cause I'm the one at fault<br/>
            I'll never fight again<br/>
            And this is how it ends<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know what's worth fighting for<br/>
            Or why I have to scream<br/>
            But now I have some clarity<br/>
            To show you what I mean<br/>
            I don't know how I got this way<br/>
            I'll never be alright<br/>
            So, I'm breaking the habit<br/>
            I'm breaking the habit<br/>
            I'm breaking the habit tonight<br/>

          <p>
            Yeah<br/>
            Yo<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not the end, this is not the beginning<br/>
            Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision<br/>
            But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm<br/>
            And though the words sound steady, something's empty within 'em<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            We say, yeah, with fists flying up in the air<br/>
            Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there<br/>
            'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and fear<br/>
            Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Waiting for the end to come<br/>
            Wishing I had strength to stand<br/>
            This is not what I had planned<br/>
            It's out of my control<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Flying at the speed of light<br/>
            Thoughts were spinning in my head<br/>
            So many things were left unsaid<br/>
            It's hard to let you go<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I know what it takes to move on<br/>
            (Oh) I know how it feels to lie<br/>
            (Oh) all I wanna do is trade this life for something new<br/>
            (Oh) holding on to what I haven't got<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Sitting in an empty room<br/>
            Trying to forget the past<br/>
            This was never meant to last<br/>
            I wish it wasn't so<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            I know what it takes to move on<br/>
            (Oh) I know how it feels to lie<br/>
            (Oh) all I wanna do is trade this life for something new<br/>
            (Oh) holding on to what I haven't got<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Yo, yo<br/>
            What was left when that fire was gone?<br/>
            I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong<br/>
            All caught up in the eye of the storm<br/>
            And trying to figure out what it's like moving on<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            And I don't even know what kind of things I've said<br/>
            My mouth kept moving, and my mind went dead<br/>
            So, I'm picking up the pieces now where to begin<br/>
            The hardest part of ending is starting again<br/>

          </p>

          <p>
            All I wanna do is trade this life for something new<br/>
            Holding on to what I haven't got<br/>

          </p>

          <p>
            This is not the end, this is not the beginning<br/>
            Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision<br/>
            But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm<br/>

          <p>
            I dreamed I was missing<br/>
            You were so scared<br/>
            But no one would listen<br/>
            Cause no one else cared<br/>
            After my dreaming<br/>
            I woke with this fear<br/>
            What am I leaving<br/>
            When I'm done here?<br/>
            So, if you're asking me, I want you to know<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            When my time comes<br/>
            Forget the wrong that I've done<br/>
            Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed<br/>
            And don't resent me<br/>
            And when you're feeling empty<br/>
            Keep me in your memory<br/>
            Leave out all the rest<br/>
            Leave out all the rest<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Don't be afraid<br/>
            I've taken my beating<br/>
            I've shared what I've made<br/>
            I'm strong on the surface<br/>
            Not all the way through<br/>
            I've never been perfect<br/>
            But neither have you<br/>
            So, if you're asking me, I want you to know<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            When my time comes<br/>

            Leave out all the rest<br/>
            Leave out all the rest<br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Forgetting<br/>
            All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well<br/>
            Pretending<br/>
            Someone else can come and save me from myself<br/>
            I can't be who you are<br/>
          </p>
